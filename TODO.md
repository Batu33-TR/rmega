## TODO

  * Handle timeouts in download/upload
  * Handle error code -3 response, that is "A temporary congestion or server malfunction prevented your request from being processed.". I noticed that this occurs quite often when creating/deleting a folder node :/
  * Sometimes uploaded data is corrupted
  * Search for TODO in the project for other minor tasks
  * Refactor the pool class
